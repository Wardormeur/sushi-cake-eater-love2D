### Going further
#### Customisation
  Try changing :
  * the cake minimal and maximal speed
  * the player speed
  * the number of cakes!
The optimal playability I found was setting the player speed at 350 and the number of cakes to 10 ;)

#### Distribution

#### Discovering libraries
Libraries are snippets of code that format your way to write code in order to provide you common functionnalities.
It's generally recommended to not re-invent the wheel, and there are a lots of functions we wrote that are actually handled by different libraries
  * Camera
    * gamera
  * Collision
    * HC
    * Box2D
  * Controls
    * Baton
  * Maps
    * STI / tiled
    * greentea
  * Steps and seperated screens:
    * LÃ¶velyMoon
  * Animations
    * Anim8
  * GUI
    * SUIT

#### Challenges :
 * Introduce surprises : fruits that give extra-points and change the player speed randomly!
 * Extra difficulty : a timer !
 * Increase the range of speed of the cakes over time !
 * A background with sprites, some clouds maybe ?
