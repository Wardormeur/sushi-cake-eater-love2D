#### Discovering libraries
Libraries are snippets of code that format your way to write code in order to provide you common functionnalities.
There are a lots of functions we wrote that are actually handled by different libraries
  * Controls
    * Use tap for mobile
  * Camera : if you want to go into a scrolling world
  * Collision : use a collision library to detect when 2 objects are in contact
    * HC
    * Box2D
  * Steps and seperated screens:
    *
  * GUI
    * SUIT
#### Challenges :
 * Introduce surprises : fruits that give extra-points and change the player speed randomly!
 * Extra difficulty : a timer !
 * Increase speed of cakes over time
 * A background with sprites
