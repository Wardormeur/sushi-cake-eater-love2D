### Polishing
Before going further, you may have noticed a couple of issues :
 * cakes disappear if you don't catch them
 * some cakes don't reappear when you catch them
 * and your player can leave the screen !
This is because we didn't check sufficient scenarios. We call them "out of bounds".
#### Out of bounds positions
##### Character
  What we want to do is restrict the movement so that the player stays in screen.
  We already know the height and width of the screen, so we just have to be careful to only move when it's not over those borders.
  In the "update" callback, modify the movement of the player to the right like:
  ```
    if love.keyboard.isDown("right") and player.x < window.width then
  ```
  Do the to the left
  ```
    if love.keyboard.isDown("left") and player.x > 0 then
  ```
  Adapt those 2 snippets of code to use for the vertical axis, for the "up" and "down" actions !

  In the end, you should have the following code :
  ```
  {% include 'code/player-bounds.lua' %}
  ```
##### Cakes
#### Animations
